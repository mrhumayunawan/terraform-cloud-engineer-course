Step 1: Problems with Traditional Infrastructure Management

Managing infrastructure in the old way can create several problems, especially when trying to grow or keep things the same across different setups. Here are some main issues:

- **Takes Too Much Time**: Setting up different environments (like development, testing, and production) manually takes a long time. Each one might need a different setup, which makes things slower and more complicated.
- **Different Setups**: Doing things by hand can lead to differences between environments. This means something might work in one place but not in another.
- **Hard to Scale**: Adding or removing resources when needed can be slow and difficult if done manually. It takes time and effort to meet sudden demand or to reduce resources to save money.

**Example**: In a traditional setup, if your app gets more traffic, you would need to manually add more servers. This can cause delays, differences between servers, and lead to downtime or slow performance, which gives a bad experience to customers.

Step 2: How IaC with Terraform Fixes These Problems

Using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like Terraform solves many of the problems with traditional management. IaC has several clear benefits:

- **Easy to See**: Terraform lets you write your infrastructure in code, making it easy to see and understand what is set up and how it all works together.
- **Same Everywhere**: By using code, you make sure everything is set up the same way across all environments. Terraform uses files that can be shared and used again, so things donâ€™t get mixed up.
- **Simple Scaling**: Terraform makes it easy to grow or shrink your infrastructure. You just change the number of resources in the code, and Terraform will add or remove them.
- **Better Security**: You can include security rules in your code to control who can make changes. Terraform also keeps a log of changes for safety.
- **Tracks Changes**: Every change made to your setup is recorded. Terraform shows who made a change and when, which makes fixing problems easier.

**Example**: If you need to copy your production environment to create a new staging environment, Terraform lets you do this easily by using the same code, making sure everything is the same and there are no errors.
